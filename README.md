# Armor Extended

# Armor Extended

## Setup
This mod is intended for 1.19.2 Fabric. This modification requires fabric-api and owo-lib to be installed.
 
## What is it?
 
Armor Extended is a fabric mod modifying the minecraft vanilla armor calculation formula to allow for armor values over 20 to be meaningful. Minecraft caps armor values at 20 and 80% damage reduction, every armor point over that are pretty much not usefull. This mod enables the user to modify the maximum armor cap and the maximum possible damage reduction.

## Important Notice

This mod neither increases the vanilla attribute caps on values, nor does it display higher armor values over 20. AttributeFix and ArmorPoints+++ are highly recommended to get the most out of this mod. Amor Extended is changing the armor to damage reduction scale to be still a linear one: If you set the armor cap to 40 or higher it is highly recommended to increase the armor points of vanilla armor, otherwise vanilla armors will be nerfed quite harshly as an side-effect.

## Further Notices

Feel free to add this mod to any modpack. I won´t port this to forge, since forge has alredy plenty alternatives.
